A realistic cup of American black coffee in a white coffee cup is placed on a wooden table in a cafe. The light is soft, and the coffee cup is undulating like waves and steaming. A white dragon is swimming and climbing from the depths of the coffee, showing the details of coffee foam and splashing water. The interior is full of animated vitality. Milk is sprayed from the dragon's mouth, and bubbles rise around him, mixing black coffee into latte. The white dragon sprays a white capital G on the surface of the coffee and then dives into the coffee. Close-up, slow panning around the coffee cup, cinematic overhead shot. 
Photorealistic style, soft lighting, high water level and realism of materials.


逼真的一杯美式黑咖啡白色咖啡杯放置在咖啡厅的木桌上,光线柔和,咖啡杯内如海浪般波动起伏冒着热气，一条白色巨龙在从咖啡深处游动爬升，呈现出咖啡泡沫和水花飞溅的细节，内部充满了动画般的生命力,龙嘴里喷出牛奶,气泡在他周围升起,将黑咖啡混成拿铁，白龙在咖啡表面喷出一个白色大写的G后潜入咖啡中.特写镜头，缓慢的摇摄环绕咖啡杯，电影般的俯拍镜头.照片写实的风格，柔和的灯光，高水位和材质的真实感。


海妖的歌声

The bird in the picture is chirping: It's Biden's fault for not putting this idiot on Alligator Island.
图片中的这只鸟在嘎嘎嘎的叫:都是拜登的错，他没把这个傻逼关进鳄鱼岛.

The bird in the picture flew from a distance, spread its wings and jumped on the branches, chirping and calling in Cantonese:
图片中的鸟儿从远处飞来，张大着翅膀在树枝上跳来跳去，嘎嘎并使用广东话叫着:丢你老母
